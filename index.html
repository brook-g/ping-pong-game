      Welcome to the Ping Pong game! You control the left paddle with your mouse.
      Your goal is to hit the ball back to your opponent's side without letting it pass your paddle.
      The right paddle is controlled by a simple AI that will try to hit the ball back to your side.
      Have fun!
